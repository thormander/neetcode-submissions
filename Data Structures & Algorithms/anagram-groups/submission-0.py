'''
anagrams have exact same character count as another

inefficient, but a starting a point:
    sort the strings and compare them n^2

hashmap -> occurance of character* | word

loop through and get the counts of each string and check if it is in our hashmap
- if it is append the word, otherwise just make a new one

occurance of character* = [0,0,0,...] --> index represents the character (ie. index 0 = a)
    - to relate letter to index, use ord() to convert a letter to its unicode value a-a, b-a, c-a ....
